# Personal Unix Coreutils Learning Repo

Hello there

This is a personal repository where I am learning about Unix core utilities by rewriting each and every one of them. What better way to learn than by diving into the actual code and implementation?

## Disclaimer

This repository is **not** intended for actual use in production. The utilities here are basic and not optimized. It's simply a learning project to help me understand how these core utilities work.

At this point, AI has been used to help me better understand the code I'm rewriting.

If you're looking for minimal, POSIX-compliant core utilities, I recommend checking out [sbase](https://git.suckless.org/sbase), a project by [Suckless](https://suckless.org/). It provides a better user experience and is much more efficient than this project.

## Purpose

- Learn the inner workings of Unix core utilities.

## Note

Feel free to explore

Happy learning!
